        <h1>About William Z Chadwick</h1>
        <p>Hello! This website is about me and some of my meager accomplishments.</p>
        <p>Feel free to have a look around. :)</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Language, Ethics, Tech</h2>
        <p>I care deeply about the intersections of language, ethics, and technology.</p>

        <p>I intend to eventually include several different sections, such as:</p>
        <ol><p>Technical portfolios:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Graphic Design work (showcased on <a href="https://www.behance.net/CardioLeo" target="_blank">Behance</a>)</li>
            <li><a href="file:///home/user/Coding/myWebsite/html_files/Cert-Proj.html" target="_blank">Projects and Coding Certifications</a></li>
            <li>Technical Writing Samples</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Humanities related work:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>professional tutoring <a href:"#">references</a></li>
            <li>language experience</li>
            <li>(hopefully) poetry publications</li>
        </ul></ol>

        <p>I've also started a blog, <a href="https://perilousresonance.wordpress.com/">PerilousResonance.wordpress.com</a>, which will hopefully include a podcast eventually. (Check it out, or don't)</p>
