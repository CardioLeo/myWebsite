<p>He spends his time doing some mix of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>studying coding languages (C++, Bash, Python3, JavaScript, HTML, CSS...),</li><br>
    <li>thinking about design, typography, and graphic design,</li><br>
    <li>tutoring high school and college students,</li><br>
    <li>working as a caregiver for the elderly and special needs communities,</li><br>
    <li>studying foreign languages (German, Japanese, Spanish, biblical Hebrew, Welsh...),</li><br>
    <li>doing sudoku, origami, mind-bending puzzles, learning to tie climbing knots, rock climbing,</li><br>
    <li>and last but not least, teaching his kids to read, explore, climb, build and more.</li>
</ul>
<br>
