        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! This website is about me and some of my meagre accomplishments.</p>
        <p>Feel free to have a look around. :)</p>
        
        <p>I care deeply about the intersections of ethics, language, and technology.</p>

        <p>I intend to eventually include several different sections, such as:</p>
        <p>Technical portfolios:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>my Graphic Design portfolio</li>
            <li>my programming portfolio</li>
            <li>my technical writing portfolio</li>
        </ul>
        <p>and my Humanities related projects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>tutoring recommendations</li>
            <li>language experience</li>
            <li>(hopefully) poetry publications</li>
        </ul>
